As an Economist with advanced training in Statistics, I specialize in applied econometrics, dynamic optimization methods, and data science. My expertise extends to research focused on the environment, energy markets, and food, energy, and water (FEW) systems resilience. I thrive on leveraging my strong analytical and quantitative skills to transform unstructured challenges into researchable inquiries, answerable using data to generate actionable insights. Beyond teaching and research, I have collaborated with organizations and businesses on projects that involved data analytics and visualization providing tangible value.

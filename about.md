As an Economist with advanced training in Statistics, I specialize in applied econometrics, causal inference methods, and machine learning. My expertise extends to data visualization and research focused on environmental, market, and food, energy, and water (FEW) systems. I thrive on leveraging my strong analytical and quantitative skills to transform unstructured challenges or open-ended problems into researchable inquiries, utilizing data to generate insights and add tangible value. s1wBeyond teaching and research, I collaborate with organizations and businesses on projects that include data analytics and visualization.

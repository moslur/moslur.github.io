I am an Economist with advanced training in Statistics. My expertise is in applied econometrics (causal inference methods), data science, data visualization and research about the environment, and food, energy, and water (FEW) systems. I enjoy applying my strong analytical and quantitative skills to convert unstructured problems into researchable questions that can be answered with data to provide sight and value.
